# Custom sounds
  
If you want to access the feedback sounds you can go to  
`/usr/share/snips/assistant/custom_dialogue/sound`  
and add your new sounds.  
Make sure that it is a 16 signed Bit wav file otherwise volume will be low  
(you can convert your wav file into 16 bit with tools like Audacity).
